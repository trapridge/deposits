# Hello üëãüèª

## Tasks

1. Set up a database to hold the data model (see below)
2. Populate the database with from [migration.csv](./migration.csv)
3. Set up a server that responds to ping ([01-test-ping.sh](./bin/01-test-ping.sh))
4. Add a route for listing users ([02-test-list-users.sh](./bin/02-test-list-users.sh))
5. Add a route for adding a user ([03-test-add-user.sh](bin/03-test-add-user.sh))
6. Add a route for adding a deposit for a user ([04-test-add-deposit.sh](bin/04-test-add-deposit.sh))
7. Update the user list to return the account balance for each user

### You should

- Use TypeScript to complete the tasks
- Create a repository for your code
- Commit **each** task separately
- Test each task with the associated script 

### You can
- Use whatever libraries or frameworks
- Use whatever database (or persistence mechanism)
- Google and stackoverflow as much as you like
- Reuse your own existing code

## Data model

- We have users
- We have deposits
- Users can have zero or more deposits
- Withdrawals are represented as negative deposits
- A user's balance is the sum of their deposits

## Migration data

The migration data consists of a **deposit listing** given by the accounting department.

This listing can be found in the [migration.csv](./migration.csv) file and contains the following:

```csv
alice@example.com,100
bob@example.com,50
alice@example.com,-75
```

In essence the data describes two distinct users, Alice and Bob, with the following deposits:

- Alice deposits 100 money
- Bob deposits 50 money
- Alice withdraws 75 money
